<div class="para">Before stating this major theorem, we should explain what the phrase “the following are equivalent” (sometimes written “TFAE” in scratchwork or on the board) means. A theorem of this type is essentially a giant if and only if theorem. Specifically, each statement in the theorem is true or each statement in the theorem is false. It is not possible for some to be true and some to be false. In a theorem with, say, three statements, we often prove that statement 1 implies statement 2, statement 2 implies statement 3, and statement three implies statement 1. Then you can start at any statement and reach any other statement, showing that if one is true, all the others must be true. However, with longer lists, we sometimes have to prove things a bit more piecemeal.</div>
