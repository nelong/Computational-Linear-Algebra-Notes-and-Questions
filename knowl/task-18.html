<em class="emphasis">Direction of Turning</em>: The direction of turning is measured by checking to see if the steering wheel is turned left or right. We are not measuring how much the wheel is turned in either direction, just whether the wheel is turned left or right. If the steering wheel is not turned either way at instant we measure the direction of turning, then we say there is no direction of turning (because the car isn't turning at that instant). Is the direction of turning a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="driver_road.html#task-18" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
