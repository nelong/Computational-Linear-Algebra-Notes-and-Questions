<div class="para">Now we know the story of Romeo and Juliet.  In our situation, Romeo is desperately in love with Juliet, but Juliet is more fickle than what Shakespeare had in mind.  In fact, the more Romeo loves Juliet, the more Juliet wants to run away and hide.  This discourages Romeo and he starts to love Juliet less, strangely this is exactly the moment that Juliet finds Romeo more attractive and she begins to love him.  On the other hand, Romeo notices again that Juliet is warming up to Romeo and he begins to warm up to her as well.  Will the eager beaver (Romeo) ever find true love with the ever fickle and cautious lover (Juliet)?</div>
