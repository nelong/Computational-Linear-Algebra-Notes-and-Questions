<div class="para">We don't usually draw what a solution set of a linear equation in four variables looks like because drawing in four dimensions is difficult. The graph os a single linear equation in four variables would be called a hyperplane in <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-space. Although we don't draw <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> hyperplanes in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-space, the intersections of hyperplanes will work very similarly to the pictures we can draw in 3-space (also known as <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>).</div>
