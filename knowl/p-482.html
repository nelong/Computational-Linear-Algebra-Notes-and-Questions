<div class="para">The solution to a linear continuous dynamical system involves evaluating a matrix exponential.  This is not a straightforward task and the evaluation algorithm is highly suspect in many situations.  In fact, one of the most cited papers in all of applied mathematics is written by Van Loan and Moler (founder of Matlab) titled<a class="external" href="" target="_blank">19 Dubious Ways to Compute the Exponential of a Matrix</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> written in 1978.  This paper and idea was so important in computational science and applied mathematics that it was revised by the same authors and updated 25 years later titled appropriately <a class="external" href="" target="_blank">19 Dubious Ways to Compute the Exponential of a Matrix, Twenty-Five Years Later</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.3.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>. In short, the papers primary contribution is to show that there is no accepted way to evaluate a matrix exponential for all matrices and the algorithm choice is matrix dependent. Dr. Beauregard's research takes a particular interest in symplectic approximations as they preserve fundamental physical quantities.</div>
