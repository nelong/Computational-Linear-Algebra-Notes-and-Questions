<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Let's consider the operator <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{d}{dx}\)</span> from the space <span class="process-math">\(C^1([0,1])\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(C^0([0,1])\text{.}\)</span> In first semester calculus, you saw how you could factor out constant coefficents from derivatives and split up derivatives into different terms in a sum (<span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{d}{dx} (a f(x)+b g(x))=a \dfrac{df}{dx}+ b\dfrac{dg}{dx}\)</span>). The other thing to note here is that this operator takes differentiable functions to continuous functions (the domain and range of this function are a bit different).</div> <div class="para">We can also define the integral operator as going from <span class="process-math">\(C^0([0,1])\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(C^1([0,1])\)</span> by considering <span class="process-math">\(f(x) \rightarrow \int_0^x f(u) \: du\text{.}\)</span> Integration is another operation that will perserve linear combinations.</div> <div class="para">Let's consider the mapping <span class="process-math">\(DE\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(C^\infty(\mathbb{R})\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(C^\infty(\mathbb{R})\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(f(x) \rightarrow \dfrac{d^2 f}{dx^2}-3\dfrac{df}{dx}+2 f(x)\text{.}\)</span> You should take couple of minutes to show that <span class="process-math">\(DE(a f(x) + b g(x))=a DE(f(x)) + b DE(g(x))\text{.}\)</span> This shows that the set of solutions to <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{d^2 f}{dx^2}-3\dfrac{df}{dx}+2 f(x) =0 \)</span> is a vector space. This kind of idea shows how we can find a set with a couple of different solutions that will span the set of all solutions to a differential equation.</div></article></body>
