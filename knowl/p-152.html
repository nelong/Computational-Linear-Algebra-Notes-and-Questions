<div class="para">We have seen how vector equations relate to a system of equations and how to frame different questions in terms of whether it is possible to find a linear combination from a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> that equals a target vector. This was the same as asking if our target vector was in the span of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> When we looked at vector equations, we also looked at whether there was a unique linear combination or whether there are many ways to write a target vector as a linear combination.</div>
