<div class="introduction"><div class="para">In this activity, we want to determine if the different measurements that are described are a property of the driver or the road. A measurement is a property of the driver if the value(s) of that measurement <em class="alert">can</em> be different for different drivers (when measured at the same location on the racetrack). A measurement is a property of the road when different drivers <em class="alert">must</em> have the same value(s) (when measured at the same location on the racetrack).</div></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Let's start by looking at a couple of easy measurements. Is the time elapsed a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.</div>

<div class="para">Now that we are warmed up, let's look at some more interesting measurements.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Speedometer Reading</em>: The car's speedometer reading measures how fast (as a scalar) the car is moving. Is the car's speedometer reading a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<div class="para">What vector calculus quantity is the speedometer reading?</div>

<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Odometer Reading</em>: The racecar's odometer measures the distance traveled by the car. Every car's odometer is set to be zero at the start of the race. Is the car's odometer reading a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h4>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Direction of Travel</em>: Each race car has a 1 meter arrow attached to the hood of the car which points straight ahead. This arrow will measure the three dimensional vector that is the direction of travel. Is the direction of travel a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(g)</span></h4>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Direction of Turning</em>: The direction of turning is measured by checking to see if the steering wheel is turned left or right. We are not measuring how much the wheel is turned in either direction, just whether the wheel is turned left or right. If the steering wheel is not turned either way at instant we measure the direction of turning, then we say there is no direction of turning (because the car isn't turning at that instant). Is the direction of turning a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(h)</span></h4>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Pedal Usage: We measure the pedal usage as either +, -, or zero in the following way:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">+ if the gas pedal is being used</div></li>
<li><div class="para">- if the brake pedal is being used</div></li>
<li><div class="para">zero if no pedal is being used</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">Since our race car drivers are safety minded, they do not use more than one pedal at a time. Note that this measurement will just be a sign and not a numerical value. The pedal usage will give us the sign of which vector calculus quantity? Be sure to explain your answer.</div>
