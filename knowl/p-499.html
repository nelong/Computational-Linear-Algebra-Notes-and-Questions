<em class="alert">Example 3: Medical imaging or inverse image problems in geology</em> Think about trying to create an image of the materials inside a patient or of the different geologic structures like water or crude oil inside some rock structure. These images are created by measuring signal strengths that correspond to density changes along a path then reorienting and getting data on a new set of points. The big idea is to create an image of the 3D structure from these linear measurements. Rotation transformations and projections are key tools here and create a host of other problems when you need to select an slice of the 3D model to display on a 2D computer screen (for diagnostic purposes). In particular, it is a difficult question to figure out how best to fill in between measurements and retain accuracy. AI tools for sharpening pictures are an example of another linear algebra application of how to interpolate data related to these imaging problems. Sonar data is the opposite from a perspective approach. Your signal and detector are not moving; instead you are looking at your surroundings with respect to relative orientation.</div>
