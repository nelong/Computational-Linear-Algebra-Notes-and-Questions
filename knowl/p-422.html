<div class="para">When examining an electrical circuit with a resistor, capacitor, and an inductor, it is useful to look at how the current (a measure of the flow of electricity) changes as a function of time. The dynamical system in this case would consist of <span class="process-math">\((X,R)\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is the set of possible functions with input <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is the rule given by the differential equation <span class="process-math">\(L \dfrac{d^2 I}{dt^2} + R \dfrac{d I}{dt} +\frac{1}{C} I =0\text{.}\)</span> In this equation the current is <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> and the constants <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> are the resistance, inductance, and capacitance of the individual components of the circuit.</div>
