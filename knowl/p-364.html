<div class="para">You often label this as time zero and state the values for the different planets' position and velocity at time zero. This leads to even more questions like "If the initial configuration of planets was a bit different, would the long term behavior still be the same?" This example is a continuous dynamical system since we look how the states of the system evolve in terms of a continuous variable (time in this case). This particular system is quite complicated and has been a focus of science, philosophy, and religion for quite some time.</div>
