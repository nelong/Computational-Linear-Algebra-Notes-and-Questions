<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Let our state space be the set of all possible collections of position, velocities, and times of the sun and nine planets (Pluto is still a planet to me...). You might store each planet's position, velocity, and time as a vector then we would say that the ten vectors are the current state of the system and the rule for evolution would be the the force of gravity. In this way, each state leads to the next by following the dynamical rule.</div> <div class="para">The field of dynamical systems would study questions like 1)if this system always has a solution, 2)what properties solutions typically have, or 3) what is the long term behavior of solution? Another important part of the system above would be an initial condition, or the state of the system at beginning.</div> <div class="para">You often label this as time zero and state the values for the different planets' position and velocity at time zero. This leads to even more questions like "If the initial configuration of planets was a bit different, would the long term behavior still be the same?" This example is a continuous dynamical system since we look how the states of the system evolve in terms of a continuous variable (time in this case). This particular system is quite complicated and has been a focus of science, philosophy, and religion for quite some time.</div></article></body>
