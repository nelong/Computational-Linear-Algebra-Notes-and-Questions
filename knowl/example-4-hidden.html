Let our dynamical system be <span class="process-math">\((\mathbb{R},f(x)=x^2)\text{.}\)</span> This means that our state space is the set of real numbers and our current state evolves according to the rule <span class="process-math">\(x \rightarrow x^2\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Notice here that we can only apply our rule (apply the function<span class="process-math">\(f\)</span>) in discrete amounts.

Will all initial values have this same long term behavior? How many different long term behaviors can you find?</div></article></body>
