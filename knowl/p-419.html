<div class="para">Let examine how eigenvalues and eigenvectors could help us easily understand the long term behavior of a linear difference equation. In particular, we will assume that we have a difference equation given by a <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and that we can find a set of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> linearly independent eigenvectors, <span class="process-math">\(\{\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2, \ldots, \vec{v}_n\}\text{,}\)</span> with eigenvalues <span class="process-math">\(\{\lambda_1,\lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n\}\text{.}\)</span> This is actually a really big assumption and is NOT true in general, so the discussion below will not be enough to analyze the general case. Because we have a set of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> linearly independent vectors from <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\text{,}\)</span> we can put them as columns of a matrix and apply the Invertible Matrix Theorem to demonstrate that this set will also span all of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\text{.}\)</span> This means that no matter what initial values we take for our system, we can write that initial value as a linear combination of the set <span class="process-math">\(\{\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2, \ldots, \vec{v}_n\}\text{.}\)</span> In other words, there is a solution to the vector equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\vec{x}_0 = c_1 \vec{v}_1 + c_2 \vec{v}_2 + \ldots+ c_n \vec{v}_n
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">for every <span class="process-math">\(\vec{x}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n\text{.}\)</span> Because these vectors in our spanning set are not just some vectors, but rather are eigenvectors of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we will be able to write out the rest of the sequence and understand the long term behavior regardless of initial values of our system.</div>
