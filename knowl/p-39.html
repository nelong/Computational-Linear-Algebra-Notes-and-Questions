<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_solve_sys_prac.html" title="Activity 1.2.4">ActivityÂ 1.2.4</a>, note that you didn't change anything but the <em class="emphasis">coefficients</em> in the system of equations as you traded one system for another. Some of the coefficients probably became zero, but you didn't really eliminate any variables or consider a totally different problem. We will use matrices to efficiently store, and manipulate the coefficients in a system of linear equations, since they are all that matter for now. Matrices will have <em class="emphasis">many</em> uses in this and other courses, and we will use capital letters like <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> to denote matrices. Matrices will be rectangular arrays with the same number of entries in each row and the same number of entries in each column. The size of a matrix is given (in order) as the number of rows by the number of columns, so a <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> matrix has <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> rows and <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> columns.</div>
