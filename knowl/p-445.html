<div class="para">Since we have such a nice description and clean algebra to solve systems of differential equations of the form <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{d \vec{x}}{dt}=A \vec{x}\text{,}\)</span> it is common to write other types of questions in terms of a system of first order differential equations. For example, if we consider the damped harmonic oscillator (an object moving on a spring with some friction), then the system follows the differential equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
m \dfrac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\alpha \dfrac{d x}{dt}- k x
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span> is the function of time that measures the position of the object (as measured from the rest length of the spring), <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is the mass of the object, <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is the spring constant, and <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is the coefficent of friction for the object. This is called a second order differential equation because it involves a second derivative of the objective function, but we can rewrite this as first oder differential equation of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{y}(t) =\colvec{\dfrac{dx}{dt}(t) \\ x(t)}\text{.}\)</span> In particular,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\dfrac{d\vec{y}}{dt}=\colvec{-\frac{\alpha}{m} \dfrac{dx}{dt}- \frac{k}{m} x \\ \dfrac{dx}{dt}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Which takes the form <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{d\vec{y}}{dt}=A\vec{y}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(A==\begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\alpha}{m} \amp - \frac{k}{m} \\ 1 \amp 0 \end{bmatrix}\text{.}\)</span> Thus by analyzing the second component of our solution, <span class="process-math">\(\vec{y}(t)\text{,}\)</span> we can give the solution to <span class="process-math">\(m \dfrac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -\alpha \dfrac{d x}{dt}- k x\)</span>
