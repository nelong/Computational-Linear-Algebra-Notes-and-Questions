  "title": "Solving Linear Systems",
  "body": " Solving Linear Systems   Elementary Operations     To understand the language and tools of efficently solving linear systems of equations    To understand how to use matrices to store information about and solve linear systems    To understand how echelon forms will give a form for equivalent systems of equations that will allow us to characterize the types of solutions to the system     Our first discussion of linear algebra will cover the ideas of efficiently solving a system of linear equations and matrix operations.  A system of linear equations in variables can be written: The term is the coefficient of the -th variable (denoted ) in the -th equation. In these notes, we will only consider real values for the coefficients of our linear systems, i.e. . A solution is a choice of variable values that satisfies all equations in the system. A solution is not a particular variable value but must include a choice for all variables in the system. The solution set for a system of equations is the set of all possible solutions. We will have many ways to describe solutions to a system this semester but they all specify the values of , , ..., and , typically as an ordered -tuple ( , , â€¦, ).   Is a solution to the following system?    The previous problem shows how easy it is to check if a set of variable values is a solution. However, finding a solution or the set of all solutions is harder but very important to many problems. Generally speaking, the process of finding the solution set for a system of equations is to trade the system of equations you have for an equivalent system (a system with the same solution set).    For each pair of equations given, state whether is equivalent to .   and  and  and   Hopefully it will be easier to explicitly write the solution set of the new equivalent system.    An elementary operation on a system of equations is an operation of the form:  multiplying an equation by a non-zero scalar  switching two equations  adding a multiple of one equation to another equation        For this question, we will consider the following system of linear equations:    Multiply the second equation in our system by negative three and state the new system of equations.  Write a few sentences about why the new system of equations given in the previous part is equivalent to the original system.   Write out the equation obtained by multiplying the second equation in the original system by a non-zero scalar (which we will call ) and adding to the first equation.  Replace the second equation in the original system with your answer to the previous part, which we will call System 2. Prove that System 2 is equivalent to the original system. In other words, you need to show that is a solution of the equations :  if and only if  is a solution to System 2.     Solve the following systems just using elementary operations. Remember to show your work.             A system of equations is consistent if there exists at least one solution to the system. In other words, a consistent system of equations has a nonempty solution set. A system that is not consistent is said to be inconsistent .  In , note that you didn't change anything but the coefficients in the system of equations as you traded one system for another. Some of the coefficients probably became zero, but you didn't really eliminate any variables or consider a totally different problem. We will use matrices to efficiently store, and manipulate the coefficients in a system of linear equations, since they are all that matter for now. Matrices will have many uses in this and other courses, and we will use capital letters like and to denote matrices. Matrices will be rectangular arrays with the same number of entries in each row and the same number of entries in each column. The size of a matrix is given (in order) as the number of rows by the number of columns, so a by matrix has rows and columns.  In order to specify what entry we are referring to in a matrix, we need an ordered pair of indices telling us the number of the row and number of the column to look in respectively. For instance, if , then the entry of is in the third row and 2nd column. You could also write this as . The -th row of a matrix will be denoted and the -th column will be denoted .  In order to distinguish vectors (as being more than just by matrices), we will use the arrow notation and lower case symbols like and to denote vectors. Unless otherwise stated, we will use column vectors. For instance, if , then the second component of is the scalar . The size of a vector in is the number of components the vector has. In later work, we will deal with a much more general notion of vectors that will not have components like vectors in .  The coefficient matrix of a linear system of equations in variables is a by matrix whose entry is the coefficient of the -th variable, , in the -th equation of the system. The augmented matrix of a linear system of equations in variables is a by matrix whose first columns are the coefficient matrix of the system and the last column is the constant terms from the right side of each equation.  The system has a coefficient matrix and an augmented matrix of   For some properties of the system of equations, we need only look at the coefficient matrix but others will need the augmented matrix. It is important to know the difference and be able to state which corresponding matrix you are using in your work.    For each system given, write the coefficent matrix.                        For each system given, write the corresponding augmented matrix.                       The elementary operations on equations outlined above will correspond to elementary row operations on matrices as well. Specifically, an elementary row operation on a matrix is an operation of the form:  multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar  switching two rows  adding a multiple of one row to another row      Using the matrix given below, perform each of the following row operations:                 We now have operations to trade our system of equations for an equivalent system, but we have not stated a way to make sure that the solution set will be easy to explicitly state from our new equivalent system. The following matrix forms will be useful for determining solution sets and various other properties of the corresponding system of equations.    A rectangular matrix is in row echelon form if it has the following three properties:  All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros.  Each leading entry (being the first non-zero entry) of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it.  All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros.    If a matrix in row echelon form satisfies the following additional properties, then we say the matrix is in reduced row echelon form :  The leading entry in each nonzero row is 1.  Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column.      The leading entry in a nonzero row of the row echelon form is called a pivot . The column in which a pivot occurs is called a pivot column and the corresponding variable is a basic variable or pivot variable . A variable corresponding to a column in which the coefficient matrix does not have a pivot are called free variables . While the echelon form is needed to find where pivots will occur, we will sometimes refer to pivot positions of a matrix even when the matrix is not in echelon form.    For each of the following matrices, determine if the matrix is in row echelon form, reduced row echelon form, or neither. If the matrix is in row echelon or reduced row echelon form, treat the matrix like an augmented matrix and describe each variable as either a free variable or a pivot variable.                       The reduced row echelon form of a rectangular matrix is unique.    It is important to note that the row echelon form of a matrix is not unique.    Give an example of a matrix that has the following properties. If such a matrix cannot exist, explain why.    satisfies the first two properties of row echelon form but does not satisfy the third.   satisfies the first and third properties of row echelon form but does not satisfy the second.   satisfies the second and third properties of row echelon form but does not satisfy the first.   satisfies the three properties of row echelon form but does not satisfy the first property of reduced row echelon form.   satisfies the properties of row echelon form and the first property of reduced row echelon form but does not satisfy the second property of reduced row echelon form.    In this example, we will list out ALL of the possible row echelon forms of a two by two matrix. We will use the symbols for a non-zero entry and for an entry that can be any real number. We will also use and for entries that must be and . You should think carefully to see if there are any possibilities missing here.  In this example, we will list out ALL of the possible reduced row echelon forms of a two by two matrix. We will use the symbols for a non-zero entry and for an entry that can be any real number. We will also use and for entries that must be and . You should think carefully to see if there are any possibilities missing here.     List out all possible row echelon forms of 3 by 4 matrices using the symbols for a pivot, for a non-pivot entry (possibly ), and (when an entry must be ). For each of these, list out which variables are pivot variables and which are free variables.   There are 15 possible.     List out all possible reduced row echelon forms of 3 by 4 matrices using the symbols for a pivot, for a non-pivot entry (possibly ), and (when an entry must be ). What value must the entries be? For each of these, list out which variables are pivot variables and which are free variables.      Solve each of the following systems by converting to an augmented matrix and using elementary row operations to reduce the augmented matrix to reduced row echelon form. With each reduced row echelon form, put a box around all pivot entries. Use the system of equations corresponding to the reduced row echelon form to write out the solution set for each system.                     Once you have the augmented matrix for a system of linear equations in reduced row-echelon form, how do you use it to determine the solution set for the system? Write a step-by-step procedure that is general enough to be used on any system of linear equations. Be aware of any implicit assumptions you're making (and try to avoid them).    Two of the most important questions we will consider this semester are:  Is the system consistent?  If a solution exists, is the solution unique?      Look back at your results so far and try to figure out what properties of the system (or corresponding matrices) will help us answer question 1 and which properties of the system will help us answer question 2. Write a conjecture about each question.     "

  "title": "Geometric Interpretations and Applications",
  "body": " Geometric Interpretations and Applications   In this section we will look at some examples of geometric interpretation of solutions to a system of linear equations, then we will look at a few examples of common application problems related to our study of linear systems.    Geometric Interpretation of a Solution Set  Recall from earlier, that the solution set of a linear equation in two variables was a line in (the plane) and that the solution set of a system of two equations in two variables was possibly a point, a line, or empty. Similarly, the solution set for a linear equation in three variables will be a plane in 3-space ( ).     List out all the possible ways two planes can intersect in a three dimensional space.  List out all the possible ways three planes can intersect in a three dimensional space.  List out all the possible ways four planes can intersect in a three dimensional space.  List out all the possible ways five planes can intersect in a three dimensional space.     We don't usually draw what a solution set of a linear equation in four variables looks like because drawing in four dimensions is difficult. The graph is a single linear equation in four variables would be called a hyperplane in -space. Although we don't draw hyperplanes in -space, the intersections of hyperplanes will work very similarly to the pictures we can draw in 3-space (also known as ).  We can use the open source computer algebra system SageMath to plot things, and we can even do it right here in the course notes. Click the button to plot a plane below.   Plotting the equations, , , and in red, yellow, and green respectively gives:    Does your answer to make sense with this plot? Explain.     For each of the systems in , use SageMath to draw a plot of each of the equations in the system and write a sentence for each system about why the plot and your answer to make sense.    You can edit the code block above and click the button again, and it will update the graph.    If you remember parametric equations of lines and planes in space from multivariable calculus, then we will return to those ideas soon    Applications and Linear Algebra  Many network or physical problems are diagramed by a figure that displays how different parts are connected and how much of something can flow between different nodes. A particularly common diagram is that of electric circuits. We will look at a couple of laws now that help us set up a system of equations for common circuit types.  An electrical network is a specialized network where we specify the locations of resistors, batteries, devices powered by sources, and others.The goal is often to determine the current through various locations of the network. In balancing a network we use two specific laws: Current and Voltage .  Current Law: sum of the currents flowing into any node is equal to the sum of the currents flowing out of that node. This is often called the conservation of flow.  Voltage Law: The sum of the voltage drops around any circuit is equal to the total voltage around the the circuit, most likely provided by batteries or other power source.    The above laws are attributed to Gustav Kirchhoff and are called Kirchhoff's Laws . We should also mention Ohm's Law, which describes the force, in volts, associated with the current (amps) passing through a resistor (ohms). Namely,    Consider the electrical network shown here   An electrical circuit  We can set up the equations for the three currents using our voltage and current law in conjunction with Ohm's Law. This yields   The first equation is using our conservation of flow. The second equation is using Ohm's law with our voltage law around the circuit CABC. The third equation is similar, but around the circuit DABD.  The rref of the corresponding augmented matrix is Thus we have a unique solution of .     For this activity, we will be considering the following circuit   An electrical circuit     Write out the current equations for each of the four junctions  Write out the voltage drop equations for three of the basic circuits.  Use Python to input the corresponding augmented matrix and solve the system based on the rref. Explain the meaning of your solution.   Another common application of linear systems is balancing a physical system according to conservation of some property. For instance, in chemical reactions, the number of different atoms of an element does not change, rather the way they are arranged in molecules is what changes. Thus the number of each kind of molecule must be the same on the right and left side of a reation equation.   Let's look at the simple chemical equation for creating water from hydrogen and oxygen. We want to know how many molecules of each type are needed to go into the reaction and how many will come out. Note that the coefficents in this setting must be positive integers since we cannot have a fraction of a molecule.  If we consider the number of hydrogen atoms in the reaction, we get If we consider the number of oxygen atoms in the reaction, we get Thus we get the following system which has augmented form which can be reduced to   Notice that there is NOT a unique solution to system of equations, but rather we can have solutions of the form Therefore, the smallest integer solution is when , which gives the following chemical reaction      Consider the chemical reaction    Write out equations for nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms  Input the corresponding augmented matrix into Python and use the rref to write out the solution set  Write out the simplest form of the chemical reaction equation.     Find the coefficents for quadratic polynomial of the form that goes through the points (-1,3), (2,2), and (3,5).     "

Unless otherwise stated, we will use column vectors. For instance, if , then the second component of is the scalar . The size of a vector in is the number of components the vector has. In later work, we will deal with a much more general notion of vectors that will not have components like vectors in . Recall that two vectors in are equal if and only if all of their components are equal.  Geometrically, we will view vectors in as an arrow which change in the -th coordinate being given by the -th component of the vector. For instance, the vector will have a plot in 3-dimensions that looks like    Vectors do not have a particular beginning or ending point so all of the blue vectors in the following plot are representations of .   Vectors can be added together to measure the net change (done by completing one vector, then the other). Algebraically, vector addition is done componentwise. If and , then .   Many other vector operations can be done componentwise, such as scalar multiplication and subtraction. If and , then . If , then . Geometrically, scalar multiplication will stretch (and flip if ) the arrow for a vector.

  "body": " Linear Independence  We have seen how vector equations relate to a system of equations and how to frame different questions in terms of whether it is possible to find a linear combination from a set that equals a target vector. This was the same as asking if our target vector was in the span of . When we looked at vector equations, we also looked at whether there was a unique linear combination or whether there are many ways to write a target vector as a linear combination.  In this section we will introduce the idea of linear independence and how that relates to the uniqueness of these linear combinations. Let's consider the homogeneous vector equation: Notice that this always has a solution. What is it?  Is it possible to have another solution to this equation? Let's generate a couple of examples.   Give a set of two vectors from , and , such that has more than one solution. Justify your answer.  Give a set of two vectors from , and , such that has only one solution. How do you know there is only one solution?     A set of vectors is linearly independent if the only linear combination of elements of that equals the zero vector is the trivial linear combination. In other words, being a linear independent set implies that if where , then all .  A set of vectors is linearly dependent if the set is not linearly independent. More specifically, there exists a solution to where and at least one of the .      Is the set linearly independent?      Is the set linearly independent?
