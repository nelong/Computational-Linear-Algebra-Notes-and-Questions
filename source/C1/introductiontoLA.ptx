  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the following diagram of a network with the flows indicated:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <image width = "80%" source = "./TrafficFlowExample.png" />
      <caption>A network with directions of flow</caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      If all the flows, <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, <m>x_3</m>, <m>x_4</m>, and <m>x_5</m>, are all nonnegative, what is the <alert>largest possible value</alert> for <m>x_3</m>?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <hint>
    <p>
      To answer this consider the following:
      <ol>
        <li>For each node (A, B, C, D) set up a conservation equation. Remember the flow in must equal the flow out.</li>
        <li>How many linear equations do you have? How many unknowns?</li>
        <li>Use your conservation equations for A and D to solve for <m>x_3</m> in terms of <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_5</m>. How might we solve for <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_4</m> in terms of <m>x_3</m> and <m>x_5</m>?</li>
        <li>Is our solution unique?</li>
      </ol>
