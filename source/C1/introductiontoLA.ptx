      Wait, what just happened? Explain the results of the previous two activities. What do the graphs of the corresponding solution sets look like in relation to the graphs of the equations?

      What are the possible intersections of two lines? Clearly state your conjecture.

  Throughout this course we will be doing many of the same things you did in the previous questions, but we will do them in a more general setting that will allow us to solve <em>many</em> new and old problems.

  <title>Application Warmup Problem</title>
  <p>
    Here is an application problem where you can see the relevence of your work you just did.
  </p>
  <activity>
    <title>Introduction to Traffic Flow</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the following diagram of a network with the flows indicated:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <image width = "80%" source = "./TrafficFlowExample.png" />
        <caption>A network with directions of flow</caption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        If all the flows, <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, <m>x_3</m>, <m>x_4</m>, and <m>x_5</m>, are all nonnegative, what is the <alert>largest possible value</alert> for <m>x_3</m>?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        To answer this consider the following:
        <ol>
          <li>For each node (A, B, C, D) set up a conservation equation. Remember the flow in must equal the flow out.</li>
          <li>How many linear equations do you have? How many unknowns?</li>
          <li>Use your conservation equations for A and D to solve for <m>x_3</m> in terms of <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_5</m>. How might we solve for <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_4</m> in terms of <m>x_3</m> and <m>x_5</m>?</li>
          <li>Is our solution unique?</li>
        </ol>
