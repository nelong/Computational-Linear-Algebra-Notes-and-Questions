  <title>Linear Independence</title>

<p>
  We have seen how vector equations relate to a system of equations and how to frame different questions in terms of whether it is possible to find a linear combination from a set <m>S</m> that equals a target vector. This was the same as asking if our target vector was in the span of <m>S</m>. When we looked at vector equations, we also looked at whether there was a unique linear combination or whether there are many ways to write a target vector as a linear combination.
</p>
<p>
  In this section we will introduce the idea of linear independence and how that relates to the uniqueness of these linear combinations. Let's consider the homogeneous vector equation:
  <me> c_1 \vec{v}_1 +c_2 \vec{v}_2 + \ldots + c_n \vec{v}_n =\vec{0}</me>
  Notice that this <alert>always</alert> has a solution. What is it?
</p>
<p>
  Is it possible to have another solution to this equation? Let's generate a couple of examples.

      Give a set of two vectors from <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>, <m>\vec{v}_1</m> and <m>\vec{v}_2</m>, such that <m>c_1 \vec{v}_1 +c_2 \vec{v}_2  =\vec{0}</m> has more than one solution. Justify your answer.

<definition>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A set of vectors <m>S</m> is <term>linearly independent</term> if the only linear combination of elements of <m>S</m> that equals the zero vector is the trivial linear combination. In other words, <m>S</m> being a linear independent set implies that if <m>c_1\vec{v_1}+c_2\vec{v_2}+...+c_k \vec{v_k}=\vec{0}</m> where <m>\vec{v_i} \in S</m>, then all <m>c_i=0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A set of vectors <m>S</m> is <term>linearly dependent</term> if the set is not linearly independent. More specifically, there exists a solution to <m>c_1\vec{v_1}+c_2\vec{v_2}+...+c_k \vec{v_k}=\vec{0}</m> where <m>\vec{v_i} \in S</m> and at least one of the <m>c_j \neq 0</m>.
