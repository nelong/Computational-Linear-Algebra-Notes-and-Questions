  <title>Curves</title>
  <p>
    Throughout calculus you have studied functions and their corresponding graphs. Typically you were given a function of the form <m>y=f(x)</m> and were asked to construct or identify a corresponding graph, such as
  </p>
  <image width = "60%" source = "images/graphf.jpg" />
  <p>
  A more powerful means of constructing curves in two dimensional space can be found through the use of  parametric equations. A <em>parametric equation</em> is of the form
  <me>c(t) = (x(t), y(t))</me>
  where <m>t</m> is called the <em>parameter</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
  For each value of <m>t</m> we obtain an <m>(x,y)</m> coordinate.  The graph of all the coordinates constitutes a <em>(parametric) curve.</em>

    <title>Pre-class Activity on Parametric Equations in 2D</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        For <xref ref="param_act1">Activity</xref>, we will examine the parametric equations given by <m>x(t)=t-2</m> and <m>y(t)=4-t^2</m> and the corresponding graph.

    <task>
      <statement>
  <p>
    In the table given on the left of <xref ref="desmos_param_table">Figure</xref>, you should enter at least seven values into the <m>t</m> column. How are the numbers you are entering relating to the points being graphed?

      </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Use both positive and negative numbers for <m>t</m>, such as <m>-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3</m>. You should also consider values that are not integers.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </task>

    <p>
      Explain what shape you think the points given by these parametric equations will draw. Be sure to note any particular features of that graph that you can identify from examining your set of points in <xref ref="desmos_param_table">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
  </task>
  <task>
    <p>
      You should draw your seven points by hand on a set of axes and label each point with its corresponding <m>t</m> value. If you think of <m>t</m> as time, the value of <m>t</m> shows you how an object would move along this curve over time. This idea is often referred to as <em>orientation</em>.

    <p>
      Sometimes we can revert back to equations in terms of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> by <em>eliminating the parameter</em> <m>t</m>. Notice that for the equation above we have
      <me>x(t) = t-2  \qquad \text{and} \qquad y(t) = 4-t^2.</me>
      <ol>
        <li>Solve <m>x=t-2</m> for <m>t</m>.</li>
        <li>Substitute the result for <m>t</m> from the last part into the equation <m>y=4-t^2</m> to get an equation in terms of just <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. Be sure to write down your equation and specify what shape the graph of this equation will have.</li>
        <li>Graph the equation in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> from the previous part using the input box that starts with <m>y=</m> (in <xref ref="desmos_param_table">Figure</xref>). Does your equation in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> give you the same picture as the parametric equations?</li>

  <title>Circles</title>
  <p>
    From basic trigonometry you should remember the Pythagorean identity
    <me>\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1.</me>
    You may also remember from algebra that
    <me>x^2+y^2 = 1</me>
    gives us the equation of the unit circle. Matching these two tells us that the basic parametric equation for the unit circle is given by 
    <me>x(t) = \cos(t) \quad y(t)=\sin(t) \qquad 0 \leq t \leq 2\pi</me>
