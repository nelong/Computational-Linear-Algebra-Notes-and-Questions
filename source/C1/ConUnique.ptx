  <title>Consistency and Uniqueness Theorems</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
  In class, we came up with statements of the following two theorems:
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_consistency">
  <title>Consistency Theorem</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A system of equations is consistent if and only if the row echelon form of its augmented matrix has no pivot entries in the rightmost column. Equivalently, a system of equations is inconsistent if and only if the row echelon form of its <em>augmented</em> matrix has a pivot entry in the rightmost column.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<theorem xml:id="thm_uniqueness">
  <title>Uniqueness Theorem</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A system of <m>m</m> equations with <m>n</m> variables has a unique solution if and only if its <em>augmented</em> matrix has <m>n</m> pivot entries and no pivot entry in the rightmost column.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

      Using the statement of the <xref ref="thm_consistency" text="title" /> and <xref ref="thm_uniqueness" text="title" />, treat each of your answers to <xref ref="ex_3x4_REF" /> as an <em>augmented</em> matrix of a linear system of equations and state:
      <ol>
        <li>whether each corresponding system of equations will be consistent, inconsistent, or you can't tell.</li>
        <li>whether each corresponding system of equations will have a unique solution, multiple solutions, no solutions, or you can't tell.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>

      Using the statement of the <xref ref="thm_consistency" text="title" /> and <xref ref="thm_uniqueness" text="title" />, treat each of your answers to <xref ref="ex_3x4_REF" /> as a <em>coefficient</em> matrix of a linear system of equations and state:
      <ol>
        <li>whether each corresponding system of equations will be consistent, inconsistent, or you can't tell.</li>
        <li>whether each corresponding system of equations will have a unique solution, multiple solutions, no solutions, or you can't tell.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <hint>
    <p>You will probably need to restate the theorems or think about
    how coefficient matrices are different to augmented matrices!</p>
