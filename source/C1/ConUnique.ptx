<introduction>
  <p>
  In class, we came up with statements of the following two theorems:
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_consistency">
  <title>Consistency Theorem</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A system of equations is consistent if and only if the row echelon form of its augmented matrix has no pivot entries in the rightmost column. Equivalently, a system of equations is inconsistent if and only if the row echelon form of its <em>augmented</em> matrix has a pivot entry in the rightmost column.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<theorem xml:id="thm_uniqueness">
  <title>Uniqueness Theorem</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      A system of <m>m</m> equations with <m>n</m> variables has a unique solution if and only if its <em>augmented</em> matrix has <m>n</m> pivot entries and no pivot entry in the rightmost column.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

  <statement>
    <p>For the matrix below, verify that the matrix is in rref (reduced row echelon form) and treat the matrix as an augmented matrix for a system of linear equations. Write out the corresponding system of equations. Use this system of equations to write each variable in terms of just free variables and constants.

        \begin{bmatrix}
          1 \amp 0 \amp 3 \amp 0 \amp -4 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp 5 \\ 
          0 \amp 1 \amp 4 \amp 0 \amp 3 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp -6 \\

<question>
  <p>
    Under what conditions would your process for the previous activity not work? In other words, when would it not be possible to write each variable in terms of just free variables and constants.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Give an example matrix that fits each of the following conditions:
        <ol>
          <li>A 3 by 4 augmented matrix corresponding to a linear system with a unique solution </li>
          <li>A 3 by 4 augmented matrix corresponding to a consistent linear system of equations that does NOT have a unique solution </li>
          <li>A 3 by 4 augmented matrix corresponding to an inconsistent system of linear equations </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Using the statement of the <xref ref="thm_consistency" text="title" /> and <xref ref="thm_uniqueness" text="title" />, treat each of your answers to <xref ref="ex_3x4_REF" /> as an <em>augmented</em> matrix of a linear system of equations and state:
      <ol>
        <li>whether each corresponding system of equations will be consistent, inconsistent, or you can't tell.</li>
        <li>whether each corresponding system of equations will have a unique solution, multiple solutions, no solutions, or you can't tell.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      Using the statement of the <xref ref="thm_consistency" text="title" /> and <xref ref="thm_uniqueness" text="title" />, treat each of your answers to <xref ref="ex_3x4_REF" /> as a <em>coefficient</em> matrix of a linear system of equations and state:
      <ol>
        <li>whether each corresponding system of equations will be consistent, inconsistent, or you can't tell.</li>
        <li>whether each corresponding system of equations will have a unique solution, multiple solutions, no solutions, or you can't tell.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <hint>
    <p>You will probably need to restate the theorems or think about
    how coefficient matrices are different to augmented matrices!</p>
