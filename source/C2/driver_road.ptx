    In this exploration, we will look at several different measurements as we consider race car drivers completing one lap around the track seen in <xref ref="racetrack_plot">Figure</xref>.

    All of the drivers in our race are going the same way around the track, all start at the same location at <m>t=0</m>, all complete one lap of the track, and all of the cars have perfect grip of the road (the racecars are never sliding). The picture of the racetrack above is given so you have an example to help you think about the tasks in this problem, not because any particular feature of the track has to be considered for the following exploration.

  <title>Is it a property of the driver or the road?</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this activity, we want to determine if the different measurements that are described are a property of the driver or the road. A measurement is a property of the driver if the value(s) of that measurement <alert>can</alert> be different for different drivers (when measured at the same location on the racetrack). A measurement is a property of the road when different drivers <alert>must</alert> have the same value(s) (when measured at the same location on the racetrack).
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <task>
    <p>
      Let's start by looking at a couple of easy measurements. Is the time elapsed a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.
    </p>
    <hint>Remember that we are NOT asking if the driver or road can control time. We are asking if the elapsed time is the same for all drivers at a fixed point on the racetrack or if drivers can have a different elapsed time to a particular location on the racetrack.</hint>
  </task>
  <task>
    <p>
      Is position (the location of the car on the racetrack) a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.
    </p>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You should make sure you understand that the measurements for different drivers must be made at the same location on the track, as stated above. Your explanation sentence may sound a little silly.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </task>
  <task>
    <p>
      Now that we are warmed up, let's look at some more interesting measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Speedometer Reading</em>: The car's speedometer reading measures how fast (as a scalar) the car is moving. Is the car's speedometer reading a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.
    </p>
  </task>
  <task>
    <p>
      What vector calculus quantity is the speedometer reading?
    </p>
    <hint>The vector calculus quantities we have covered are time, position, velocity, acceleration, speed, arc length, unit tangent, unit normal, binormal, curvature, tangential acceleration component, normal acceleration component, and osculating circle.</hint>
    <hint>This is an easy one, I hope.</hint>
  </task>
  <task>
    <p>
      <em>Odometer Reading</em>: The racecar's odometer measures the distance traveled by the car. Every car's odometer is set to be zero at the start of the race. Is the car's odometer reading a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.
    </p>
  </task>
  <task>
    <p>
      <em>Direction of Travel</em>: Each race car has a 1 meter arrow attached to the hood of the car which points straight ahead. This arrow will measure the three dimensional vector that is the direction of travel. Is the direction of travel a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.
    </p>
  </task>
  <task>
    <p>
      <em>Direction of Turning</em>: The direction of turning is measured by checking to see if the steering wheel is turned left or right. We are not measuring how much the wheel is turned in either direction, just whether the wheel is turned left or right. If the steering wheel is not turned either way at instant we measure the direction of turning, then we say there is no direction of turning (because the car isn't turning at that instant). Is the direction of turning a property of the driver or the road? Be sure to explain your answer.
    </p>
  </task>
  <task>
    <p>
      Pedal Usage: We measure the pedal usage as either +, -, or zero in the following way:
      <ul>
        <li>+ if the gas pedal is being used</li>
        <li>- if the brake pedal is being used</li>
        <li>zero if no pedal is being used</li>
      </ul>
      Since our race car drivers are safety minded, they do not use more than one pedal at a time. Note that this measurement will just be a sign and not a numerical value. The pedal usage will give us the sign of which vector calculus quantity? Be sure to explain your answer.

      The explanations for the next tasks may be difficult for you to write but will be very helpful in ensuring you understand the vector calculus concepts of this chapter. This is a continuation of <xref ref="driver_road_act">Exploration</xref> and all of the same constraints still apply.
