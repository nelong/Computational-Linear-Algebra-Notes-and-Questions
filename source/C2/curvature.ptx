    In this section, spherical coordinates are introduced in terms of two linear measurements and one angular measurement.

    In the first lesson on spherical coordinates in three dimensions, the measurements of the <m>\rho</m>, <m>\theta</m>, and <m>\phi</m> coordinates are introduced. Several examples are given showing the geometric measurements for each coordinate. Since <m>\phi</m> is measured in a different way than previous coordinates, there is a focus on the measurement of this coordinate. The activity below follows up with a brief exploration on coordinate measurements and graphs of equations.
