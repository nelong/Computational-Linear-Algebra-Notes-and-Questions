  <title>Inverse Matrices</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this section, we will only consider square matrices.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <p>
      A matrix <m>A \in M_{n \times n}</m> is <term>invertible</term> if there exists a matrix <m>B</m> such that <m>AB=Id_n</m> and <m>BA=Id_n</m>. The inverse matrix of <m>A</m> is denoted <m>A^{-1}</m>.
    </p>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Be careful that you do not use the notation <m>A^{-1}</m> until you have shown that <m>A</m> is invertible. By inverse, we mean the multiplicative inverse for a matrix. A matrix that is not invertible is called a <term>singular matrix</term>. A <term>non-singular matrix</term> is an invertible matrix.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the next couple of sections we will examine the following two questions:
    <ul>
      <li>How can you efficently calculate the inverse matrix for a given <m>A</m>?</li>
      <li>How can you determine when a matrix is invertible without finding its inverse?</li>
    </ul>

  <title>Computing Inverses</title>

<investigation>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We will look at a way to find the inverse matrix of <m>A</m> in terms of the matrix-vector product and how that can be used as a representation of matrix multiplication.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <task>
    <p>
      We want to find a matrix <m>C</m> such that <m>AC=Id</m>. So let's expand <m>C</m> as columns.
      <me>AC=A [\vec{c}_1 \; \vec{c}_2 \; \ldots \; \vec{c}_n]=[A\vec{c}_1 \; A\vec{c}_2 \; \ldots \; A\vec{c}_n]</me>
      Using this perspective on the equation <m>AC=Id</m>, we get
      <me>A\vec{c}_1=\colvec{1 \\ 0\\0\\\vdots\\0}, \; A\vec{c}_2=\colvec{0 \\ 1\\0\\\vdots\\0}, \: \cdots, \; A\vec{c}_n=\colvec{0 \\ 0\\0\\\vdots\\1}</me>
      How would we find out if there were any solutions to these matrix equations?
    </p>
  </task>
  <task>
    <p>
      How could you find solutions to all of these matrix equations all at once?
    </p>
  </task>
</investigation>


<p>
  In general computing the inverse of a matrix takes more time and operations than solving a system of equations. For this reason, it is generally easier to find and solve a related system of equations problem than to compute the inverse matrix. We will outline a few ways to find inverse matrices and compute a few small examples.
</p>

<investigation xml:id="q11">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Any sequence of elementary row operations that reduces <m>A</m> to <m>Id_n</m> also transforms <m>Id_n</m> into <m>A^{-1}</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</investigation>

<p>
  The previous result shows that computing inverses is equivalent to a row reduction problem. In particular, if <m>A</m> is invertible, then reducing <m>[ A \quad | \quad Id_n]</m> to reduced row echelon form will produce the matrix <m>[ Id_n \quad | \quad A^{-1}]</m>.

      Use the result of the previous investigation to find the inverse of the matrix <m>\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \\ 3 \amp 4 \end{bmatrix}</m>. Check your work by computing <m>AB=Id_n</m> and <m>BA=Id_n</m> for the matrix you think is the inverse of <m>A</m>.

      Use the idea above to compute the inverse of <m>\begin{bmatrix} a\amp b\\c\amp d \end{bmatrix}</m>. Be sure to note any assumptions you will need to make in order to reduce <m>[ A \quad | \quad Id_n]</m> to <m>[ Id_n \quad | \quad A^{-1}]</m>.

      If <m>A=\begin{bmatrix} 0\amp -1\\3\amp 4 \end{bmatrix}</m>, find <m>A^{-1}</m> and use your answer to solve <m>A\vec{x} = \vec{b}</m> if:

  <p>
    Your friend Nick, who thinks he knows everything, claims that <m>(AB)^{-1}=A^{-1}B^{-1}</m> because that's how exponents work. Is he right? Justify your answer like you are going to have to convince Nick.
  </p>
  <hint>
    <p>
      Mulitply Nick's Result on both sides by the matrix <m>(AB)</m> and simplify.
