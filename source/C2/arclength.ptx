<question>
  <p>
    A shark, which can shoot a laser beam straight ahead, travels along the path parameterized by <m> \overrightarrow{ \textbf{r}}(t) = \langle5-t,21-t^2,3-\frac{t^3}{27}\rangle</m>. Show that there is precisely one time <m>t</m> at which the shark can shoot his laser at an object located at the origin.
