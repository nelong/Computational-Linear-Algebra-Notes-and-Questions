    <title>Vector Spaces: The Big Idea</title>

    <p>Vector spaces are the primary objects that we study in linear
    algebra. Generally speaking, a vector space is a collection of
    objects (called vectors) that preserves linear relationships; that
    is, the objects work well under vector addition and scalar
    multiplication. As you will see shortly, vectors are not always
    going to be the column vectors we have seen so far or viewed geometrically as arrows from one point to another.</p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
    <p>A <term>vector space</term>, <m>V</m>, is a nonempty set of objects called <term>vectors</term> with two operations called addition and scalar multiplication such that the following hold for all <m>\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w} \in V</m> and <m>c,d \in \mathbb{R}</m>:
    <ol>
      <li>If <m>\vec{u}, \vec{v} \in V</m>, then <m>\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in V</m>.</li>
<li> <m>\vec{u}+\vec{v}=\vec{v}+\vec{u}</m></li>
<li> <m>(\vec{u}+\vec{v})+\vec{w}=\vec{u}+(\vec{v}+\vec{w})</m></li>
<li> There exists a vector <m>\vec{0}_V</m> such that <m>\vec{v}+\vec{0}_V=\vec{v}</m>.</li>
<li> For each <m>\vec{u} \in V</m>, there is a vector <m>-\vec{u} \in V</m> such that <m>\vec{u} + (-\vec{u})=\vec{0}_V</m>.</li>
<li> If <m>\vec{u} \in V</m> and <m>c \in \mathbb{R}</m>, then <m>c\vec{u} \in V</m>.</li>
<li> <m>c(\vec{u}+\vec{v})=c\vec{u}+c\vec{v}</m></li>
<li> <m>(c+d)\vec{v}=c\vec{v}+d\vec{v}</m></li>
<li> <m>c(d\vec{v})=(cd)\vec{v}</m></li>
<li> <m>1 \vec{v}=\vec{v}</m></li>
    </ol>
You can refer to these properties as
<ol>
<li> closure of vector addition</li>
<li> commutativity of vector addition</li>
<li> associativity of vector addition</li>
<li> existence of the zero vector</li>
<li> existence of the additive inverse</li>
<li> closure of scalar multiplication</li>
<li> distributive property of scalar multiplication across vector addition</li>
<li> distributive property of scalar addition across scalar multiplication (of a vector)</li>
<li> associativity of scalar multiplication</li>
<li> existence of scalar multiplicative identity</li>
</ol>
    </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

<p>This is the definition for a <em>real</em> vector space since the scalars come from <m>\mathbb{R}</m>, the real numbers. Sometimes it will be useful for us to consider complex vector spaces (scalars come from <m>\mathbb{C}</m>), but unless otherwise stated, you should assume that you are working with a real vector space.</p>

<investigation><introduction><p>
In order to gain an appreciation of definitions, use only the above definition to prove the following results:</p></introduction>
<task>
<statement><p>The zero vector is unique. You can begin this by supposing that there exists some <m>\vec{w}</m> such that <m>\vec{x} +\vec{w} = \vec{x}</m> for every <m>\vec{x} \in V</m>, then you need to show that <m>\vec{w}</m> must equal <m>\vec{0}_V</m>.</p></statement>
</task>
<task><statement><p>The additive inverse of a vector is
unique.</p></statement></task>
</investigation>

<example>
  <p>
The real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}</m>, are a vector space since all of
the above properties hold.
  </p>
</example>
<example>
  <p>
Real valued vectors, <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, are a vector space since all
of the above properties hold when vector addition and scalar
multiplication are done componentwise. We can think of the vectors in
<m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> as a directed line segment (an arrow) or as a
point in <m>n</m>-dimensional space.
  </p>
</example>


<investigation><statement><p> Show why <m>\mathbb{Z}^n</m>, the set of vectors with <m>n</m> integer components is not a vector space.
</p></statement></investigation>

<investigation><statement><p> Is <m>\mathbb{C}^n</m> a real vector space? Why or why not?
</p></statement></investigation>

<investigation><statement><p> Is <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> a complex vector space? Why or why not?
</p></statement></investigation>

<example><p>
The set of <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> matrices over the real numbers,
<m>M_{m \times n}(\mathbb{R})</m> or simply <m>M_{m \times n}</m>, is
a vector space since all of the above properties hold when
<q>vector</q> addition and scalar multiplication are done entry
wise. The quotes are around vector in the previous sentence because
you may not always think of matrices as being vectors but using the
properties from <xref ref="sec_matrix_ops" />, you can treat matrices as vectors in the general sense.</p></example>


<investigation xml:id="vse"><introduction><p>The set of polynomials
(in variable <m>t</m>) of degree at most <m>n</m> is denoted by
<m>\mathbb{P}_n</m>.</p>

</li>
<li> <m>F(S,\mathbb{R})</m>, the set of functions from a set <m>S</m> to the real numbers. We will take a closer look at this vector space in the next problem.</li>
<li> <m>\{\vec{0}\}</m>, the <term>trivial vector space</term>.</li>

<investigation>
  <introduction>
    <p> We are going to take a look at the
vector space <m>V=F(\{a,b,c\},\mathbb{R})</m> to get used to our more
general way of thinking about vectors and vector spaces. You should
think of the vector space <m>V</m> as the set of functions with domain
<m>\{a,b,c\}</m> and codomain <m>\mathbb{R}</m>. In other words, we
are looking at the set of functions that only use <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
and <m>c</m> as inputs and have outputs of real numbers.

  <li>Let <m>g_1</m> be the function that takes
<m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> to <m>3</m>, <m>-2</m>, and <m>0</m>
