  <title>Graphics and Linear Algebra</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
    Computer graphics are generated by specifying points in space and how to connect them. 
    Curves are usually approximated by line segments, surfaces by using triangles. 
Changes in graphics correspond to manipulating these points. 

GPUs are very efficent at calculating linear transformations for common manipulations

For instance

rotation

Shear

Projection

reflection

shrink/expand

Can do this as a tranformation from 2D to 3D (embedding pictures in a 3D environment)

Want to be efficient, algorithmic, and not case based (GPUs excel at these ideas then)
