  We will formalize some of the work done in Project 3, specifically the generalization of the dot product to vector spaces in general.

<definition>
  <title>Inner Product</title>
  <p>
    An <term>inner product</term> is a bilinear operation (denoted <m>\langle . , . \rangle</m>) from a vector space <m>V \times V</m> to <m>\mathbb{C}</m> that satisifies the following: if <m>x,y,z\in V</m> and <m>k\in \mathbb{C}</m> then 
    <ol>
      <li> <m>\langle x , y \rangle = \overline{\langle y,x\rangle}</m></li>
      <li> <m>\langle x , y+z \rangle = \langle x,y \rangle +\langle x,z\rangle </m></li>
      <li> <m>\langle  k x , y \rangle = k \langle x,y \rangle</m></li>
      <li> <m>\langle  x , x \rangle \geq 0</m>, <m>\langle x,x\rangle =0</m> iff <m>x= \vec{0}</m></li>
    </ol>
    A vector space <m>V</m> with a choice of inner product is called an <term>inner product space</term>.

  <title><m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> and the dot product</title>
<p>
  The dot product (<m>\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} =\sum_i v_i w_i</m>) is an inner product for our first example of a vector space, <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>.
</p>
</example>
<example>
  <p>
    As we developed in Project 3, we can define an inner product of <me>\langle f,g \rangle =\int_a^b f(x) g(x) \enspace dx </me> for <m>f,g \in C^0([a,b])</m>. because integrals are lienar with respect to the functions being integrated.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is not just one inner product that we could define on <m>C^0([a,b])</m>. We could give a weighting of the the points in our region of integration and define a weighted integral which will still give an inner product. Specifically, we could define <me>\langle f,g \rangle_{w(x)} =\int_a^b f(x) g(x) w(x) \enspace dx </me> for <m>f,g \in C^0([a,b])</m>. For instance, if <m>f(x)=x</m> and <m>g(x)=^2</m>, then <m>f,g\in C^0(\mathbb{R})</m> but the unweighted inner product <me>\langle f,g\rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) g(x) \enspace dx</me> will not be defined for <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>. The weighted inner product with <m>w(x) = e^{-x^2}</m> exists for <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> because <me>\langle f,g\rangle_{w(x)} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) g(x) e^{-x^2} \enspace dx</me> converges to a finite value.
  </p>
</example>
<p>
  If we look at a set of of functions, <m>S=\{\phi_k(x)\} \subset C^0(\mathbb{R})</m>, we can still consider the span of that set, <me>Span(S)=\{g(x)|g(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \phi_i(x)\}</me>
  While the span of this set is unlikely to be all of our vector space <m>C^0(\mathbb{R})</m>, we can still ask what function from the span is closest to a given function. The inner product (like the dot product) gives us a way to measure how much functions move together, so we can try to find the function from <m>Span(S)</m> that will maximize it's inner product with a given <m>g \in C^0</m>. If this sounds like a projection vector problem, good news, it is!
</p>
<p>
  Let's consider our set <m>S=\{\phi_k(x)=\sin(\frac{k \pi x}{L})\}</m> as a subset of functions/vectors from <m>C^\infty(\mathbb{R})</m>. What kind of functions can we write as a linear combination from <m>S</m>? For one thing, all of the linear combinations of functions from <m>S</m> will be periodic and will have zeros at 0 and <m>L</m>.
