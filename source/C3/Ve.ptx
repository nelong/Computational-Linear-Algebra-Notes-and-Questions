    <title>Definitions</title>

    <p>Vector spaces are the primary objects that we study in linear
    algebra. Generally speaking, a vector space is a collection of
    objects (called vectors) that preserves linear relationships; that
    is, the objects work well under vector addition and scalar
    multiplication. As you will see shortly, vectors are not always
    going to be the column vectors we have seen so far or viewed geometrically as arrows from one point to another.</p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
    <p>A <term>vector space</term>, <m>V</m>, is a nonempty set of objects called <term>vectors</term> with two operations called addition and scalar multiplication such that the following hold for all <m>\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w} \in V</m> and <m>c,d \in \mathbb{R}</m>:
    <ol>
      <li>If <m>\vec{u}, \vec{v} \in V</m>, then <m>\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in V</m>.</li>
<li> <m>\vec{u}+\vec{v}=\vec{v}+\vec{u}</m></li>
<li> <m>(\vec{u}+\vec{v})+\vec{w}=\vec{u}+(\vec{v}+\vec{w})</m></li>
<li> There exists a vector <m>\vec{0}_V</m> such that <m>\vec{v}+\vec{0}_V=\vec{v}</m>.</li>
<li> For each <m>\vec{u} \in V</m>, there is a vector <m>-\vec{u} \in V</m> such that <m>\vec{u} + (-\vec{u})=\vec{0}_V</m>.</li>
<li> If <m>\vec{u} \in V</m> and <m>c \in \mathbb{R}</m>, then <m>c\vec{u} \in V</m>.</li>
<li> <m>c(\vec{u}+\vec{v})=c\vec{u}+c\vec{v}</m></li>
<li> <m>(c+d)\vec{v}=c\vec{v}+d\vec{v}</m></li>
<li> <m>c(d\vec{v})=(cd)\vec{v}</m></li>
<li> <m>1 \vec{v}=\vec{v}</m></li>
    </ol>
You can refer to these properties as
<ol>
<li> closure of vector addition</li>
<li> commutativity of vector addition</li>
<li> associativity of vector addition</li>
<li> existence of the zero vector</li>
<li> existence of the additive inverse</li>
<li> closure of scalar multiplication</li>
<li> distributive property of scalar multiplication across vector addition</li>
<li> distributive property of scalar addition across scalar multiplication (of a vector)</li>
<li> associativity of scalar multiplication</li>
<li> existence of scalar multiplicative identity</li>
</ol>
    </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

<p>This is the definition for a <em>real</em> vector space since the scalars come from <m>\mathbb{R}</m>, the real numbers. Sometimes it will be useful for us to consider complex vector spaces (scalars come from <m>\mathbb{C}</m>), but unless otherwise stated, you should assume that you are working with a real vector space.</p>

<investigation><introduction><p>
In order to gain an appreciation of definitions, use only the above definition to prove the following results:</p></introduction>
<task>
<statement><p>The zero vector is unique. You can begin this by supposing that there exists some <m>\vec{w}</m> such that <m>\vec{x} +\vec{w} = \vec{x}</m> for every <m>\vec{x} \in V</m>, then you need to show that <m>\vec{w}</m> must equal <m>\vec{0}_V</m>.</p></statement>
</task>
<task><statement><p>The additive inverse of a vector is
unique.</p></statement></task>
</investigation>

<example>
  <p>
The real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}</m>, are a vector space since all of
the above properties hold.
  </p>
</example>
<example>
  <p>
Real valued vectors, <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, are a vector space since all
of the above properties hold when vector addition and scalar
multiplication are done componentwise. We can think of the vectors in
<m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> as a directed line segment (an arrow) or as a
point in <m>n</m>-dimensional space.

</p></statement></investigation>

<investigation><statement><p> Is <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> a complex vector space? Why or why not?
</p></statement></investigation>

<example><p>
The set of <m>m</m> by <m>n</m> matrices over the real numbers,
<m>M_{m \times n}(\mathbb{R})</m> or simply <m>M_{m \times n}</m>, is
a vector space since all of the above properties hold when
<q>vector</q> addition and scalar multiplication are done entry
wise. The quotes are around vector in the previous sentence because
you may not always think of matrices as being vectors but using the
properties from <xref ref="sec_matrix_ops" />, you can treat matrices as vectors in the general sense.</p></example>

  <title>Subspaces</title>

<p>As <xref ref="vse" /> shows, it can be very tedious to prove that a set is indeed a vector space. A <term>subspace</term> of a vector space is a subset that is itself a vector space. Since most of the properties of the vector spaces we look at get inherited from some larger vector space, it is often easier to show that a set is a vector space by showing it is a subspace of the appropriate parent vector space.</p>

<theorem>
  <statement>
<p>A subset <m>H</m> of a vector space <m>V</m> is a subspace if and only if the following are true:
<ol marker="(a)">
<li> The zero vector of <m>V</m> is in <m>H</m>; <m>\vec{0}_V \in H</m>.</li>
<li> H is closed under vector addition; if <m>\vec{u}, \vec{v} \in H</m>, then <m>\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in H</m>.</li>
<li> H is closed under scalar multiplication; if <m>\vec{u} \in H</m>
and <m>c \in \mathbb{R}</m>, then <m>c\vec{u} \in H</m>.</li>
</ol>
</p>
  </statement>

<proof>
  <p>We first assume that <m>H</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>. Item (a)
  of the theorem follows from axiom 4 of being a vector space. Item
  (b) of the theorem follows from axiom 1 of being a vector
  space. Item (c) of the theorem follows from axiom 6 of being a
  vector space.</p>

  <p>For the converse, we assume that <m>H\subseteq V</m> and the
  three items of the theorem satement are satisfied. We must verify
  the 10 vector space axioms:
  <ol marker ="1.">
    <li>This follows from item (b) of the theorem statement.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>
    <li>This follows from item (a) of the theorem statement.</li>
    <li>This requires proof. Since <m>-1\in\mathbb{R}</m>, item (c) of
    the theorem statement tells us that for all <m>\vec{u}\in H</m>,
    <m>(-1)\vec{u}=-\vec{u}\in H</m>. Thus, this axiom is verified.</li>
    <li>This follows from item (c) of the theorem statement.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>
    
  </ol></p>
</proof>
</theorem>

<p>This theorem is so useful because we can prove a set is a vector
space by checking only <em>three</em> properties instead of the
<em>ten</em> that are involved in the definition. The reason that we
do not need to check these other properties is that by using this
subspace, we already have proven the proper rules of arithmetic from
the parent space. Additionally, since we are using the same rules for
scalar multiplication and vector addition as the parent space, we
<em>must</em> also have the same scalars as the parent space.

</p></statement>
<solution>
  <p>The statement is true. We use Theorem 3.6 to prove this. First note that the function <m>Z(t)=0</m>
  is the zero vector for this vector space, as for any function
  <m>f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}</m>, <m>(f+Z)(t) = f(t)+Z(t) =
  f(t)+0 = f(t)</m>. To see that <m>Z</m> is odd, we have <m>Z(-t)
= 0=-0=-Z(t)</m>. Now suppose that <m>f,g</m> are odd functions. We
have
<me>(f+g)(-t) = f(-t)+g(-t)=-f(t)+(-g(t))=-(f(t)+g(t))=-(f+g)(t)</me>,
verifying the second part of the theorem is satisfied. Finally, let
<m>c\in\mathbb{R}</m>. Now <m>(cf)(-t) =
c(f(-t))=c(-f(t))=-cf(t)=-(cf)(t)</m>. Thus, the set of odd functions
are a subspace of the vector space of functions from <m>\mathbb{R}</m>
to <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
