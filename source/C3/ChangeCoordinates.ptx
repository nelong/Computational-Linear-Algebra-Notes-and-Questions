    In the previous section, we saw how advantageous our use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors was to describing the long term behavior of the linear discrete dynamical systems. We will take a few minutes here to set up the algebra of what was going on more fully.

  <title>Same Eigenvalues, Different Eigenvectors</title>

      Find the eigenvalues for the matrices <m> A=\begin{bmatrix}2 \amp 0 \\0 \amp 1/2\end{bmatrix}</m> and <m> B=\begin{bmatrix}1.25 \amp -0.75 \\-0.75 \amp 1.25\end{bmatrix}</m>. For each of the eigenvalues of these matrices, you need to find an eigenvector.

      Hopefully you noticed that these matrices have the same eigenvalues but different eigenvectors. Let <m>\vec{v}_1</m> be the eigenvector of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda_1=\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>\vec{v}_2</m> be the eigenvector of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda_2=2</m>. Let <m>\vec{w}_1</m> be the eigenvector of <m>B</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda_1=\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>\vec{w}_2</m> be the eigenvector of <m>B</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda_2=2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Find a matrix <m>C</m> such that <m>C \vec{v}_1 =\vec{w}_1</m> and <m>C \vec{v}_2=\vec{w}_2</m>.

    <p>
      Find a matrix <m>D</m> such that <m>D \vec{w}_1 =\vec{v}_1</m> and <m>D \vec{w}_2=\vec{v}_2</m>.

      Explain what just happened with matrix product <m>C A D</m>...

      Let's try to reverse engineer what just happened in the previous activity. Can we come up with the matrix that has eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1=1.5</m> and <m>\lambda_2=-1/3</m> with eigenvectors of <m>\colvec{2 \\ 1} </m> and <m>\colvec{4 \\ 1}</m>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Think about what parts of the corresponding matrix parts are given by the information above. Once you have guessed at how to write the corresponding <m>C A D</m> matrix. Test your answer by checking what the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are.
