  <title>Subspaces</title>

<p>As <xref ref="vse" /> shows, it can be very tedious to prove that a set is indeed a vector space. A <term>subspace</term> of a vector space is a subset that is itself a vector space. Since most of the properties of the vector spaces we look at get inherited from some larger vector space, it is often easier to show that a set is a vector space by showing it is a subspace of the appropriate parent vector space.</p>

<theorem>
  <statement>
<p>A subset <m>H</m> of a vector space <m>V</m> is a subspace if and only if the following are true:
<ol marker="(a)">
<li> The zero vector of <m>V</m> is in <m>H</m>; <m>\vec{0}_V \in H</m>.</li>
<li> H is closed under vector addition; if <m>\vec{u}, \vec{v} \in H</m>, then <m>\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in H</m>.</li>
<li> H is closed under scalar multiplication; if <m>\vec{u} \in H</m>
and <m>c \in \mathbb{R}</m>, then <m>c\vec{u} \in H</m>.</li>
</ol>
</p>
  </statement>

<proof>
  <p>We first assume that <m>H</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>. Item (a)
  of the theorem follows from axiom 4 of being a vector space. Item
  (b) of the theorem follows from axiom 1 of being a vector
  space. Item (c) of the theorem follows from axiom 6 of being a
  vector space.</p>

  <p>For the converse, we assume that <m>H\subseteq V</m> and the
  three items of the theorem satement are satisfied. We must verify
  the 10 vector space axioms:
  <ol marker ="1.">
    <li>This follows from item (b) of the theorem statement.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>
    <li>This follows from item (a) of the theorem statement.</li>
    <li>This requires proof. Since <m>-1\in\mathbb{R}</m>, item (c) of
    the theorem statement tells us that for all <m>\vec{u}\in H</m>,
    <m>(-1)\vec{u}=-\vec{u}\in H</m>. Thus, this axiom is verified.</li>
    <li>This follows from item (c) of the theorem statement.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>
    <li>Since <m>H\subseteq V</m> and this axiom holds for all
    elements of <m>V</m>, the axiom holds when restricted to elements of <m>H</m>.</li>

</theorem>

<p>This theorem is so useful because we can prove a set is a vector
space by checking only <em>three</em> properties instead of the
<em>ten</em> that are involved in the definition. The reason that we
do not need to check these other properties is that by using this
subspace, we already have proven the proper rules of arithmetic from
the parent space. Additionally, since we are using the same rules for
scalar multiplication and vector addition as the parent space, we
<em>must</em> also have the same scalars as the parent space.

<investigation><statement><p> Prove or disprove: The set of odd
functions on <m>\mathbb{R}</m> (i.e., those for which <m>f(-t)=-f(t)</m> for every <m>t \in \mathbb{R}</m>) a subspace of <m>F(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})</m>.
</p></statement>
<solution>
  <p>The statement is true. We use Theorem 3.6 to prove this. First note that the function <m>Z(t)=0</m>
  is the zero vector for this vector space, as for any function
  <m>f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}</m>, <m>(f+Z)(t) = f(t)+Z(t) =
  f(t)+0 = f(t)</m>. To see that <m>Z</m> is odd, we have <m>Z(-t)
= 0=-0=-Z(t)</m>. Now suppose that <m>f,g</m> are odd functions. We
have
<me>(f+g)(-t) = f(-t)+g(-t)=-f(t)+(-g(t))=-(f(t)+g(t))=-(f+g)(t)</me>,
verifying the second part of the theorem is satisfied. Finally, let
<m>c\in\mathbb{R}</m>. Now <m>(cf)(-t) =
c(f(-t))=c(-f(t))=-cf(t)=-(cf)(t)</m>. Thus, the set of odd functions
are a subspace of the vector space of functions from <m>\mathbb{R}</m>
to <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
